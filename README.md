# Java-Exam-Entrance-Calculator

A Java application that I made as part of a college assignment where you calculate if you have a passing score to write the specified module's exam.

The user chooses which of the 3 modules' score they want to calculate.
They then enter their scores for the 3 formative assignments.
If their total mark is higher than 30% after calculations, then they have passed to write their exam.
